  abstract = {Objectives This study investigated the left atrial appendage (LAA) by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to categorize different LAA morphologies and to correlate the morphology with the history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA). Background LAA represents one of the major sources of cardiac thrombus formation responsible for TIA/stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods We studied 932 patients with drug-refractory AF who were planning to undergo catheter ablation. All patients underwent cardiac CT or MRI of the LAA and were screened for history of TIA/stroke. Four different morphologies were used to categorize LAA: Cactus, Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower. Results CT scans of 499 patients and MRI scans of 433 patients were analyzed (age 59 +/- 10 years, 79\% were male, and 14\% had CHADS(2) [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age $>$75, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack] score $>$= 2). The distribution of different LAA morphologies was Cactus (278 [30\%]), Chicken Wing (451 [48\%]), Windsock (179 [19\%]), and Cauliflower (24 [3\%]). Of the 932 patients, 78 (8\%) had a history of ischemic stroke or TIA. The prevalence of pre-procedure stroke/TIA in Cactus, Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower morphologies was 12\%, 4\%, 10\%, and 18\%, respectively (p = 0.003). After controlling for CHADS(2) score, gender, and AF types in a multivariable logistic model, Chicken Wing morphology was found to be 79\% less likely to have a stroke/TIA history (odd ratio: 0.21, 95\% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.91, p = 0.036). In a separate multivariate model, we entered Chicken Wing as the reference group and assessed the likelihood of stroke in other groups in relation to reference. Compared with Chicken Wing, Cactus was 4.08 times (p = 0.046), Windsock was 4.5 times (p = 0.038), and Cauliflower was 8.0 times (p = 0.056) more likely to have had a stroke/TIA. Conclusions Patients with Chicken Wing LAA morphology are less likely to have an embolic event even after controlling for comorbidities and CHADS(2) score. If confirmed, these results could have a relevant impact on the anticoagulation management of patients with a low-intermediate risk for stroke/TIA.

  abstract = {Knowledge of left atrial (LA) anatomy is important for atrial fibrillation ablation guidance, fibrosis quantification and biophysical modelling. Segmentation of the LA from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) images is a complex problem. This manuscript presents a benchmark to evaluate algorithms that address LA segmentation. The datasets, ground truth and evaluation code have been made publicly available through the http://www.cardiacatlas.org website. This manuscript also reports the results of the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LASC) carried out at the STACOM'13 workshop, in conjunction with MICCAI'13. Thirty CT and 30 MRI datasets were provided to participants for segmentation. Each participant segmented the LA including a short part of the LA appendage trunk and proximal sections of the pulmonary veins (PVs). We present results for nine algorithms for CT and eight algorithms for MRI. Results showed that methodologies combining statistical models with region growing approaches were the most appropriate to handle the proposed task. The ground truth and automatic segmentations were standardised to reduce the influence of inconsistently defined regions (e.g., mitral plane, PVs end points, LA appendage). This standardisation framework, which is a contribution of this work, can be used to label and further analyse anatomical regions of the LA. By performing the standardisation directly on the left atrial surface, we can process multiple input data, including meshes exported from different electroanatomical mapping systems.},

  abstract = {Background Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the diagnostic modality of choice for visualizing the left atrial appendage (LAA). This study defined the morphology of the LAA in normal autopsy specimen hearts and considered the implications of these findings for TEE studies.
Methods and Results Five hundred normal autopsy hearts were reviewed (25 male and 25 female subjects from each decade for 10 decades). LAA length, width, orifice size, and number of lobes were recorded. Number of lobes was compared between sexes with the rank sum test and regressed against age. Mean length, width, and orifice size increased with age, up to age 20 years, in both sexes. Rates were significantly different between sexes for LAA size (P=.011) and width (P=.006). After age 20, statistically significant but clinically insignificant age-related changes were observed. Fifty-four percent of LAAs had two lobes (range, 1 to 4), with no age or sex differences. Lobes exist in different planes of the heart. Most pectinate muscles were $\geq$1 mm in width. Pectinate muscles $<$1 mm (2.6\% of cases) were seen in only the first and last decades.
Conclusions Age- and sex-related differences in LAA dimensions exist. These differences and the existence of multilobed appendages are important in the accurate TEE evaluation of LAA. Because lobes exist in different planes, imaging must be done in multiple planes to visualize the entire LAA.},
